# EJS

As a Node.js developer, you often encounter scenarios where you need to dynamically generate HTML content on the server-side and render it to the client. Manually crafting HTML strings can become cumbersome and hard to maintain. That's where templating engines like EJS (Embedded JavaScript) come to the rescue. EJS allows you to create dynamic HTML templates with embedded JavaScript code, making it easier to build reusable and maintainable web applications. In this blog post, we'll explore how to get started with EJS in Node.js.
